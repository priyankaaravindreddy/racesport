>The idea is to build an app which has content on a single page – which has a combination of data in the form of images, videos providing the option for the customers, to bookmark specific sections of the page.
Being a global company we would like to customize the site based on our customers geography and have a completely different set of colors for them.
>Performance – especially since the site is expected to have a lot of traffic and loads of content like high resolution race day pictures, videos with pre and post race interviews to name a few. It will also be accessed on mobile phones over 3g/4g network, so should be lighter and easier to loads on mobile phones and tablets.
>Accessibility – Since the site is to be accessed by all the fans of racing – it needs to support AAA – level of accessibility
>Degrade gracefully – there is a clear need to support browsers like IE7. The site needs to degrade gracefully on those browsers.
>Scalability and Extensibility – The solution should be scalable to support ever increasing user base and extensible to support additions of modules later and be able to scale up to support commerce/marketing integration for future requirements.
>Analytics – The Company wants to track users and their interactions on the site and thus enable analytics, which provides them with all relevant information to optimize the experience across all channels.
>Offline Viewing – The users should have the option to enable to view sections of the site made available for offline viewing.
